<h1>The Jaffa Clock Tower </h1>
<p>
The Jaffa Clock Tower (Hebrew: מגדל השעון יפו‎‎, Migdal haShaon Yafo, Arabic: يافا برج الساعة‎) is one of seven clock towers built in Palestine during the Ottoman period. <br>
The others are located in Safed, Acre, Nazareth, Haifa, Manara Clock Tower in Nablus (West Bank), and Jerusalem, the last being the only one that has not survived until today.<br>

The Jaffa Clock Tower stands in the middle of Yefet street at the northern entrance of Jaffa, the ancient city that is now a part of Tel Aviv. <br>
The tower, which is made of limestone, incorporates two clocks and a plaque commemorating the Israelis killed in the battle for the town in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.<br>
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
The tower was built to commemorate the silver jubilee of the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abd al-Hamid II. The tower was built with contributions of the residents of the city,<br> Arabs and Jews, headed by Joseph Bey Moyal.[3]

The first stone of the tower was laid in September 1900. Within a year two floors were built and the construction of a third floor had begun.<br> In 1903 the clock tower had been erected.
 It is similar to the clock tower of Khan al-Umdan in Acre that is dedicated to the same purpose.<br>
 More than a hundred similar clock towers were built throughout the Ottoman Empire due to this occasion.<br>

In 1965 the Jaffa Clock Tower was renovated, new clocks were installed and colorful mosaic windows designed by Arie Koren to describe the history of Jaffa were added.<br>

In 2004 the clock tower appeared on an Israeli stamp worth 1.3 sheqels. <br>
It was together with the clock towers in Safed, Acre, Haifa and Jerusalem featured in a series of Ottoman Clock Towers In Israel.
